I am currently a Senior undergraduate at Lawrence University receiving a B.A. in Computer Science and International Relations.

I have experience programming in Java, C++, R, Python, Javascript, Swift, and more. My [GitHub page](https://github.com/stuja16/) shows a small number of the personal projects I have worked on.
